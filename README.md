# Hi! :wave:

I'm Dami.
I built this while listening to Moon by Kid Francescoli. It gives a feel to the GIF. I urge you to try it too! ;)

Work ðŸ§° 
- ðŸ‘¯ I currently build software with Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and Ruby on Rails. Other skillset: GraphQL, REST, etc.
- âš¡ In my past job, I was an Energy Systems Designer doing 3D modeling, and PV Systems Sizing.
